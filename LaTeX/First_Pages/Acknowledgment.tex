\section*{Acknowledgments}

First of all I thank Prof. Ulbrich for the opportunity to write my thesis at his chair.
I thank my advisers for the interesting topic and the good support and guidance in the course of this thesis. Particularly I want to thank Dr. Andre Milzarek for the good communication even over longer distances and Lukas Hertlein for taking over the mentoring so naturally.
