\section*{Abstract}

Bundle methods are very popular methods when it comes to the solution of nonsmooth optimization problems. To apply them to various kinds of real world problems it is important that they are able to work with nonconvex objective functions as well as inexact evaluations of the function value and subgradient.
A survey on the different strategies that are used to tackle these issues is presented in this thesis.

A main contribution of this work is the development of a variable metric variant of the bundle method that can make use of curvature information.  
It is compared to another bundle method suitable for noisy nonconvex objective functions.
Finally the performance of bundle methods for the solution of bilevel problems is explored. This is done by using the method for the hyper-parameter optimization for a support vector classifier.
